<em>hattivatti</em> is a <em>latti</em>ce Boltzmann method solver for advection-diffusion-reaction equation.

# origin
It is hard to believe that I've NOT decided to implement Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) merely as a poor pun on the project's name.
The first article I've read that sparked the idea of writing my own LBM solver was Philip Mocz's "Create Your Own Lattice Boltzmann Simulation (With Python)" on Medium. After that I've found a self-contained repository JuliaLatticeBoltzmann to which I've added a push-back boundary condition and tested it on a porous media flow. The original code from Philip Mocz and Nappael uses a Single Relaxation Time which should be replaced with Multiple Relaxation Time very soon. Currently the code is not that efficient (which is my fault), and not really stable (as it is a rather basic LBM implementation).
